## What is Tkinter?


[**Tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) is the standard GUI library for Python. It allows developers to create desktop applications with simple widgets like buttons, labels, entries, etc. Tkinter is built into Python, so no additional installation is required for most environments.




## 📝 Discription

This project is a modern Scientific Calculator built with Python and Tkinter, designed to provide a clean and intuitive user experience across platforms.

It supports basic arithmetic and advanced functions like trigonometry, logarithms, exponents, square roots, and constants (π, e). The layout is designed to resemble a real scientific calculator, offering a user-friendly and functional GUI.
